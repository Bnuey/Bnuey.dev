    anecdote: "I went into this game with the specific goal of making a good tutorial. I've come to learn that the best tutorials are invisible to the player.One's where the player can learn what to do without any words or explanations. In the background you can see two signs showing you the controls and how to effectively use them. The player can then piece it together without me having to say 'Left Click To Use Umbrella'. This is followed by a small jump the player has to make and some boxes you can't get around.The boxes force the player to learn that their umbrella can also be used as a weapon.I was so happy watching players pick up the game and immediately understand it.Most people, even if they didn't understand immediately, would continue experimenting until they got it. My biggest regret with this game was not adding controller support. Several people found the controls too difficult even if they understood how they worked. My dad disliked the game because he found it hard to keep track of the mouse position and the player simultaneously."
