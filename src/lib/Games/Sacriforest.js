    anecdote: "I'm very critical of this game compared to all my others. The gameplay really is nothing special but that's okay. I learned so much making this game, random generation, top down movement, enemy AI, and navmeshes. Even when the game you come out with isn't great there's still great takeaways. It can be hard to look at your game objectively when you poured a lot of effort into it. But taking a step back, realizing its flaws, and learning from your mistakes is how you improve."
