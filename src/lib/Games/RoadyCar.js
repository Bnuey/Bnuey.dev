    anecdote: "Roady Car holds a special place in my heart. Without it I almost certainly would not have gone into game design. While I had experimented with making games in the past and had really enjoyed it, it was the 2023 GMTK Game Jam that really changed what I wanted to do with my life. It was a long, stressful, sleep deprived weekend but I came out of it thinking it was some of the most fun I had ever had. I learned so much about how you actually make a game, information I almost certainly wouldn't have learned otherwise. Game jams are the best ways to not only prove yourself as a game designer, but learn a ton you wouldn't have otherwise. Then at the end of it you have a product you have something you can show people or you have something you could continue to work on."
