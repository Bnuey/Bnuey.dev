    anecdote: "UPCARD is my baby, I love this game with all my heart. I had the idea for this game back in 2023 and felt like it was small enough scope to finish over the summer of 2024. How wrong I was, even with cutting out a lot of the other features I had planned it still took 2 summers of hard work to finish it. Even games that seem small are probably require at least twice as much time as you think. . . <br><br>Since this was one of my first projects, created soon after QuestionHeir, the project was a disaster as I was still trying to figure out a nice workflow. Coming back to it the next summer was painful because nothing made any sense and the codebase was a mess, but I wanted to finish this game so bad. I really enjoyed the gameplay and thought the mechanics were interesting. I had spent so much time on it already it felt wrong not to finish it. So I got everything together, reorganized the project, and found some tools that helped tremendously. <br><br> When I started I hadn't thought ahead to how I was going to add things like controller support, it was a problem for future Ashley. I'm almost glad I pushed it onto future Ashley though, with a lot more experience and another year of school under my belt I managed to come up with a lot clever solutions to all the little problems I was having. For example, controller support is completely faked, there's just a script that gets all the current interactable objects, puts them in a list, and organize them by x position. Then left and right are just bound to add or subtract 1 from the _currentSelected, and the A button simulates a click. There were more technical details to work out but that is basically how it works. Moving up and down on the typewriter? That works by just adding 9 to _currentSelected, essentially scrolling 9 objects through the list. It was such a simple solution that worked flawlessly, it was these clever solutions that made the difference in releasing the game.<br><br>UPCARD got progressively sillier and sillier as time went on, and I'm glad I doubled down on the absurdity. The game is incredibly special to me, as my first real full game. The first game on my itch page that wasn't made in a week or two. But with all due respect, I'm glad this game is out of my life. The feeling of finishing a game is unmatched, the endless grind of opening the game, playtesting, coding, animating... it's over... It hit me a couple days after I released it, I fucking finished a game and I'm so proud of myself. Almost exactly a year before the game released I compared it to a ball & chain, forever holding me back. But I broke free, it’s not perfect, theres flaws everywhere, and I wish I added more, but at a certain point you have to be done. Setting a deadline where the game HAS to be released does wonders for anyone trying to finish their own game… I came to term with the games flaws, what went wrong, where I could improve, and instead of spending another year fixing everything and perfecting it, I pushed it out the door, it’s time to move on. To start something new . . .<br><br><br>I do of course have to thank my two great friends Jayden Wisniewski and Chase Seams, they actually did me the biggest favours in the world by creating all the promotional art, and basically all the music respectively. The game wouldn't be the same without them and their work, and I thank them both for being there when I needed a helping hand the most Ɛ>"
