    info: 'Created for the 2024 OTU GDSA Game Jam <br>Theme: Not Quite Right',
    description: "A puzzle platformer where you play as a snail with a limited moveset. Stick to surfaces and solve puzzles, all while only moving left!",
    anecdote: "When the theme was announced to be 'Not Quite Right' my mind instantly jumped to a character who can only move left. This then led me to think of interesting ways in which you could move right... Which led to being a snail that can stick to surfaces. Limitations encourage out of the box thinking from the player but also me as the developer. Being able to make good puzzles is hard enough on it's own but doing it with a small moveset is incredibly difficult. I don't think this game nailed it in that department but it proved to me that the idea had merit and others seemed to agree."
