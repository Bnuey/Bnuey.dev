    description: "What if filing paperwork was... Fun? Answer questions, fill out surveys, sign away your soul and draw pictures all while the paperwork becomes more and more absurd!",
    anecdote: "This game was really fun to make. Coming up with dumb prompts and pages was such a blast although I think some of my sleep deprived ramblings somehow made it in. The feeling you get watching someone play something you made and actually laugh is unmatched. The code and gameplay was basically done on day one but it was put together so badly that creating a single page unique page took forever and is what a lot of the time went to. I def realized I needed to brush up on my code organization and project structuring after this one!"
