    anecdote: "This was my first real attempt at making a game. When we were younger we had a channel where we'd dump all of our creative projects. This game was never actually finished, it was originally created sometime in 2022. I then got 90% of the way done and never finished it. In 2023 I decided to just put it on my itch even though it wasn't finished. It was a ton of fun to make and I didn't want all that progress to go to waste."
